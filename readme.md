# nekRSbench 

nekRSbench is a benchmark suite representing key kernels of nekRS.
It serves as a lightweight tool for performance analysis on high performance computing architectures. 

### Available benchmarks
* axhelm (local or assembled constant coefficient Helmholtz operator)
* gs (sparse communcation - regular nearest neighbor exchange and irregular AMG)
* conv (dealiased convection operator) 
* nekBone (solving scalar Helmholz equation using PCG+Jaocbi)
